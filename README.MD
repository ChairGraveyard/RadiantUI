# Key Features:

* Render HTML/CSS/JavaScript to any surface/material in the game.
* No C++ coding required, everything is done through blueprints and components.
* Automatic Input handling: Walk up to any WebActor and use the mouse and keyboard automatically (Doom3 style interfaces).
* Supports non-flat surfaces: You can map a WebActor onto any mesh and still interact with it (Curved computer screens etc).
* Networked gameplay support: Multiple players can interact with the same WebActor and see the same output.

# About this repository/fork
The input on the HUD is currently not working as it should. I´m trying to make the job better, but am still not that ue4-skilled, yet.
So please don´t use this fork in any production-release.
